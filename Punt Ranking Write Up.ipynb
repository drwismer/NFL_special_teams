    "1. ***Gunner Rankings*** - Using tracking data at the snap, I matched gunners with vises. I then calculated how far gunners could get downfield 3, 4, and 5 seconds from the snap. As I'd paired gunners with opposing vises, I could calculate their downfield penetration in both absolute yardage and yardage ***relative to the vise***. I used percentile ranking on each penetration metric for all gunners that participated in at least 15 qualifying punt plays (punt of 40+ yards with no penalties). I averaged percentile rankings of all metrics to determine the final metric for ranking gunners.\n",
    "2. ***Vise Rankings*** - Vises try to prevent gunners from getting downfield. Using the same method, I ranked vises by the average penetration allowed on qualifying punt plays.\n",
    "3. ***Punt Return Degree of Difficulty*** - For punt returns, I percentile ranked four metrics. I averaged these rankings to determine \"Degree of Difficulty,\" by which all returns are ranked. The following metrics went into the rankings: \n",
    "    - Defender Proximity - I tallied the number of frames where a defender was within two yards of the returner during the return. If multiple defenders were within two yards in the same frame, that counted as two instances.\n",
    "    - Football Movement - Total distance the football traveled during the return.\n",
    "    - Return Time - Time that passed between receiving the punt and the end of the return.\n",

Degree of Difficulty is calculated by averaging the percentile rank of all returns for the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Defender Proximity** - For each frame ***during the return***, I calculated the distance between each defender and the returner. I created a binary column representing whether each defender was within two yards of the returner. Returns were percentile ranked based on the total. A score of 1.00 in Defender Proximity would be assigned to the single punt return play that contained the most instances of a defender within two yards of the returner during the return.\n",
    "- **Total Movement** - This represents ***total movement of the football*** from reception through the end of the return. Below, you'll see that for touchdowns, the percentile rank is typically near 1.00.\n",
    "- **Return Time** - Length of the return in frames. For the touchdown plays below, the return time is near 1.00.\n",
    "- **Broken Tackles** - PFF supplied identifying information for missed tacklers. I converted this data to count of broken tackles, which was percentile ranked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The percentile rankings include all punt plays that were returned (not only touchdowns). This is why Total Movement and Return Time are very near 1.00 for touchdown plays. You'll also notice that Defender Proximity doesn't approach 1.00 in the punt return touchdown rankings. This is because Defender Proximity is maximized when the punt returner is tackled. When I include all punt returns, the top ranking punt return touchdown has the 17th highest degree of difficulty. You can see these rankings if you scroll to the bottom of the workbook. Defender Proximity, as it is currently calculated, is only useful for ranking touchdown returns. When ranking punt returns regardless of the scoring result, it may be best to exclude Defender Proximity.\n",
